This makes possible to emit cross-datacenter ping metrics to datadog. Original issue: https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/SYSAPP-1122

In order to run, first config file needs to be populated with the endpoint to test ping against.
You can pass '--silent' or '-s' to it to supress script output to terminal.
